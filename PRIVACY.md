# Privacy Policy
TL;DR AutoEvent does not, and will never share any sensitive/identifiable data.

## Crash reporting
In the event that AutoEvent crashes, your device codename, Android API level, AutoEvent version and the crash log itself is sent to Google Play for review.
Crash logs do not contain any sensitive information.

## Data Usage
AutoEvent does not store or send any sensitive information. Information from notifications is used to detect possible event information. This information does not leave your device, and is not stored in any persistent storage.
Firebase may create an App Instance ID to differentiate your session from from others. This cannot be used to identify you, and is used solely for keeping track of separate app instances. This can be reset at any time from 'Manage Space' under 'App Settings'.

## Third-Party Privacy Policies
This Privacy Policy does not apply to any libraries used within Smartwatch Extensions. Libraries used include, but are not limited to:
* AndroidX components
* Google Play Billing Library
* Firebase Analytics
